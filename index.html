            <h3>NATURE</h3>
            <p>
                Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural world, physical universe, 
				material world or material universe. "Nature" refers to the phenomena 
				of the physical world, and also to life in general. Manufactured
				objects and human interaction are, in common usage, not considered 
				part of nature unless qualified in ways such as "human nature" or 
				"the whole of nature". Nature is generally distinguished from the 
				supernatural. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the galactic.

            <h3>EARTH</h3>
            <p>
                Earth (or, "the earth") the fifth largest planet in the solar system,
                third in order of distance from the Sun. It is the largest of its planetary
                system's terrestrial planets and the only place in the universe known to 
                support life.</p>

            <p>The most prominent features of the earth's climate are its two large polar regions,
               two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical
               region. Precipitation patterns vary widely according to location, ranging from 
               several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. About 70 percent of 
               the surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents
               and islands, with the vast majority of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.

            <h3>LIFE</h3>
            <p>
                Although there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists
                 generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by
                  organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and 
                  reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of
                organisms
